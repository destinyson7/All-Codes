Hello and welcome to the first edition of DeCode!

The contest, as you might have guessed by its name, is a bit trickier than usual. You will be given a problem, which you are given as usual. However, this time, you are also given the editorial and a sample solution to the problem! Unfortunately, the catch here is that the solution doesn't work on certain input cases.

Your job, as an aid to Alice, is to help her figure out on what test cases the sample solution fails, and also help her fix the sample solution.

TODO: change to a certain theme about Alice stuck in Coderland.
TODO: describe scoring
TODO: Describe input format
TODO: Describe example problem

You will be given eight problems and two hours to solve them. The contest is held on 10th Feb 2020 at 9pm, so mark your calendars now!

The contest is prepared by the brilliant minds at IIIT-H: , and tested by: . We hope you'll enjoy it. We'll post an editorial in this thread after the contest.
